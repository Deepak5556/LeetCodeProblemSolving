# LeetCode Solutions by Deepak Kumar V  

Welcome to my repository of solutions for various LeetCode problems! üöÄ  

This repository is a collection of coding challenges I have solved on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/717822f212/). It serves as a personal archive of my coding journey, and I'm sharing it to help others understand different approaches to problem-solving.  

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure  

The solutions are organized into folders based on problem categories and difficulty levels:  

- **Categories**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.  
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard  

Each folder contains solution files with the problem description, my approach, and the implemented code.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  

- **Languages**:  
  - Java  
 
- **Tools**:  
  - [LeetCode Editor](https://leetcode.com/u/717822f212/)  
  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice  

## üîç How to Use  

1. Browse through the folders to find the problem you're looking for.  
2. Each solution file includes:  
   - Problem description  
   - Explanation of the approach  
   - Code implementation  
3. Feel free to clone the repository and try out the solutions on your local system or LeetCode.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deepak5556/LeetCodeProblemSolving
