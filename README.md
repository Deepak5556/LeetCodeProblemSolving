## Introduction

Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving repository! This is a collection of Java solutions that I have written while practicing LeetCode problems. The problems span various topics such as Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and more.

Feel free to explore the repository and check out the code. I continuously update it as I tackle more problems and refine my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## LeetCode Problem Categories

The solutions are organized into different categories based on the problem type:

- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Theory**
- **Binary Trees**
- **Search and Sort Algorithms**

Each category has its own folder containing solutions to problems in that particular domain.
